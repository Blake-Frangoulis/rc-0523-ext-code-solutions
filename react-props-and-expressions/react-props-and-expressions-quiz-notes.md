## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are props in React?
  The information you pass to a JSX tag such as className, src, width, etc.

- How do you declare and access props in a component?
  Props can be passed as a parameter `(props)` and then later assigned into a variable eg: const {text, color} = props. Or they can immediately be deconstructed in the parameter eg: functionName({text, color}).

- How do you pass props to a component?
  Similar to assigning an HTML attribute. In your component you add the props name followed by the assignment operator to assign the value you'd like the prop to be set to.

- How do you write JavaScript expressions in JSX?
  By surrounding them in curly braces.
